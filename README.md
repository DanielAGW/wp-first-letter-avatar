WP First Letter Avatar
==============

A WordPress plugin to set custom avatars for users with no Gravatar. The avatar will be the first (or any other) letter of the user's name.

## Description

The plugin checks if commenter has a Gravatar assigned to his email address; if he has, Gravatar is displayed, if not - custom avatar is used. Custom avatar consists of commenter's name first letter and colorful background. 

WP First Letter Avatar helps you bring more colors into your blog. Plus, your readers will be more willing to comment on your posts since they can actually relate to these avatars much better than to the Mystery Person.

WP First Letter Avatar includes a set of beautiful, colorful letter avatars in many sizes. Optimal size will be chosen by the plugin in order to display high quality avatar and not download, for example, big 512px avatars when only 48px is needed... PSD template for avatar is also included. 

Plugin is highly configurable - you can disable Gravatar, choose different letter, use custom sets of avatars, use rounded avatars etc.

All images were compressed using the fantastic [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/), so avatars are incredibly light and ultra-high quality.
